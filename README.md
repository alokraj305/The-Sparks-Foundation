# The-Sparks-Foundation
This virtual internship program began in November 2021. I was assigned a list of task and was supposed to complete and submit before the deadline.
In this task, I imported the data from a csv file which had the data about terror attacks from 1970 to 2017, to python, cleaned it and again exported the file as an excel file.
This final version of the cleaned data was then used as the data for creating tableau dashboard.
